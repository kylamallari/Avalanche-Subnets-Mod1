# Avalanche-Subnets-Mod1

## Overview

Welcome to the thrilling world of blockchain-based gaming! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up your very own DeFi Kingdom clone on Avalancheâ€”a decentralized finance empire where players can collect, build, and battle with digital assets.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools and accounts set up before diving into the tutorial:

- Unix Computer (MacOS or Linux)
- Solidity
- Remix
- Metamask
- Web Browser

## Steps to Build Your DeFi Empire

### 1. Set up your EVM subnet on Avalanche

Follow the guide and Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network. This will give you the power to deploy smart contracts with low fees and a custom token.

### 2. Define your native currency

Set up your native currency, which will serve as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone.

### 3. Connect to Metamask

Connect your EVM Subnet to Metamask by following the steps outlined in our guide. Ensure that your custom subnet is selected as the active network in Metamask.

### 4. Deploy basic building blocks

Use Solidity and Remix to deploy foundational smart contracts for your game. These may include contracts for battling, exploring, and trading. The provided ERC20 and Vault contracts can serve as essential building blocks. Customize them according to your game rules, liquidity pools, and tokens.

#### a. ERC20 Contract
#### b. Vault Contract

```

### 5. Test your application

Use Remix to interact with your deployed smart contracts. Deploy tokens, pools, and more to test the functionalities of your DeFi Kingdom clone.
